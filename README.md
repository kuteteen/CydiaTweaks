My Cydia Tweaks
======

This is a collection of my Cydia Substrate tweaks. Tested with iOS 11+.

# Tweak List

## AutoVPN
Connect/disconnect to VPN automatically in selected apps. Support to backup app lists. Similar to [SmartVPN][sv], but fewer bugs, ad-free and open-source.

## CCVPN
A VPN toggle in Control Center for iOS 11+. Similar to [CCVPN][cv], but more reliable in iOS 11+.

## HomeGesture
A fork of [HomeGesture][hg] with no configurable options. Similar to [HomeGuesture Lite][hgl], where all options are pre-defined.

## NoSimAlert
Remove "No Sim Card Installed" alert on iOS 12. Previous tweaks are not working on iOS 12.

## (Un)forceChinese
(Un)force Mi Fit app to show in Chinese language.

# Build
Install [theos][theos] and type `make`. Use `make -j4` to speed up the build in parallel.

# License
All source code is licensed under GPLv3.
